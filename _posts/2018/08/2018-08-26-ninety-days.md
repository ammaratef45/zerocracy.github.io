  We take into account only the last 90 days while
  calculating the reputation and all other performance
  metrics of programmers, here is why.

While working under the management of Zerocrat you earn reputation
points, according to the [ยง18](http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#18) of
the [Policy](http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html). Each successful task
completion gives you as many points as big is the budget of the task. Say,
the budget is 30 minutes. You get +30 points to your reputation when it's
closed. However, the points will fade out in 90 days. Let me explain the
logic behind this rule.

Other systems, like StackOverflow for example, don't do that. If/when you
earn something there, it stays with you forever. For example, my reputation
in StackOverflow is [over 50K](https://stackoverflow.com/users/187141/yegor256)
at the moment. The majority of questions and answers that give me that
score were posted at least two years ago. Most of them were posted in 2011-2012,
which is over 6 years ago.

Is it fair?

Look at this guy: [Pascal Thivent](https://stackoverflow.com/users/70604/pascal-thivent?tab=answers).
His reputation at the moment is over 450K.
He posted his last answer in December 2010.
When I was receiving answers from him in 2010, his reputation was a bit over 100K.
This means that he earned +350% by doing ... nothing.

Is it fair?

Maybe it is in case of StackOverflow, but in Zerocracy we value programmers
by the contribution they make at the particular moment, not years ago. If you were a good
programmer (highly effective, closing many tasks and reporting many bugs)
a year ago, but stopped working later---you are not a "good" programmer anymore.

You have to "prove" your reputation if you want to keep it.

That's why we take into account only the points you've managed to earn
over the last 90 days. Everything that happened earlier is not taken into account.

Why 90? There is no particular reason. It's just a number.

If you think it should be a different number, please suggest your arguments
and we will think about it. You can even contribute with a pull request
to our policy.
