After numerous failed attempts to bring
projects to completion and release them to
our customers, I have finally found the
method to **solve my problems**. Zerocrat and
the XDSD philosophy (especially
microtasking) enable us to keep our team
focused on what is important instead of
chasing down wild geese.

Happy to mention Zerocracy as a reliable and consistent collaborator
for our super ambitious startup. Initially somewhat counterintuitive,
it was a **novelty** of guaranteeing predictable execution of sub tasks,
that was continuously gauged against timeline and budgetary constraints,
all in automated way, proved to be a secret sauce of our satisfaction.

Zerocracy provides the strategic sourcing and subject matter expertise
in a teaming environment, customizing their approach to
**fit the unique needs** and culture of their customer rather than trying to force
a rigid process onto an organization. The bottom line is that they
help get to savings faster.
