  Zerocracy solves a number of problems we
  all experience in software development projects,
  and helps optimize costs and increase quality.

Despite all our efforts,
[most](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf)
software projects suffer
[from](https://www.infoq.com/articles/software-failure-reasons):

  * High labor costs
  * Personnel turnover
  * Low maintainability
  * Low quality of code and product

We believe that most of the above is caused by broken
management, not technical incompetence. To solve this, we
recommend <del>replacing</del> empowering a human project manager with
[Zerocrat](http://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/21/zerocracy-announcement.html),
a hosted chat bot.

To make a project manageable by a computer we use a strict
[Policy](/policy.html) which derives the following principles from the
[eXtremely Distributed Software Development](http://www.xdsd.org) methodology:

  * [**&#35;NoMagic**](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html)
    ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrMKTFyohg)):<br/>
    We rely on discipline and control much more than on trust and talent.
  * [**&#35;NoSalaries**](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html)
    ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODxm7w2DE-g)):<br/>
    We pay [fixed fees](http://www.yegor256.com/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html)
    only for deliverables of [microtasks](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html),
    never per hour/month.
  * [**&#35;NoMeetings**](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html)
    ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wjczt4w46A)):<br/>
    We [don't talk](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html)
    to each other [anywhere](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html)
    outside of GitHub tickets.
  * [**&#35;NoObligations**](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html):<br/>
    We encourage programmers to work only when they find it profitable.
  * [**&#35;NoHelp**](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html):<br/>
    We don't teach programmers and we don't help them.
  * [**&#35;NoAltruism**](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html)
    ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUwE3FGfpg)):<br/>
    We encourage [egoism](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html) and
    [laziness](http://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html).
  * [**&#35;NoFear**](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html):<br/>
    We encourage programmers to find bugs and we [pay them for it](http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#29).

no loyalty: everybody works for money
no inequality: we don't care who works for us
no guilt: we work out of greed
no meetings
no estimates
no obligations
no compromises
no excuses

We realize that our approach is very
[different](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html) from all other
traditional methods of management. In our experience
our way of managing projects gives a lot of benefits to
all [stakeholders](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/10/software-project-roles.html):

  * Programmers are more [motivated](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html)
  * Costs are [lower](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html)
  * Quality is [higher](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html)
  * Maintainability is higher and turnover doesn't hurt us

To try it out, [submit an RfP](https://www.0crat.com/rfp)
and one of [our architects](https://www.0crat.com/team) will get in touch with you.
