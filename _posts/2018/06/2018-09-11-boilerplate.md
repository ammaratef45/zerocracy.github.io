Oneliner:<br/>
Zerocracy is an AI-empowered project management chatbot that
automates routine processes in software development projects,
helping managers to coordinate programmers in distributed and co-located teams.

Full abstract:<br/>
Everybody thinks that robots will replace
humans in their daily jobs, but we think
something else will happen.
With AI and modern communication
platforms computers will manage people,
not the other way around.
Computers will plan and control our routine
work, while we will do what we love to
doâ€”real work.
AI actually can replace them, decreasing
project failure rate.
Zerocracy is an AI-empowered chatbot that automates the majority
of routine and boring operations project managers often fail to
do right in software projects.
